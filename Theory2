Question: If a paired t-test produces a p-value of 0.08, what can we conclude at a 5% significance level? The null hypothesis is not rejected.
Question: A paired t-test is appropriate when:Data is collected from the same subjects before and after treatment.
Question: When comparing two proportions, what does the pooled proportion (p^) represent?The proportion of the combined groups.
Question: Which value indicates stronger evidence against the null hypothesis in a Chi-Square test? Larger Chi-Square statistic.
Question: What is the null hypothesis in a Chi-Square test of independence? Variables are independent.
Question: When would you use a Chi-Square goodness-of-fit test? To compare observed and expected frequencies.
Question: The Chi-Square distribution becomes more symmetrical with: More degrees of freedom.
Question: If you use a one-tailed test instead of a two-tailed test (with the same α), the power will usually: Increase.
Question: If you want to increase the power of your test, what's a good strategy? Increase the sample size.
Question: If the p-value is 0.01 and α=0.05, the power is:Unrelated to p-value.
Question: The power of a hypothesis test is: 1−β.
Question: Which statement is TRUE? A smaller p-value provides stronger evidence against H0.
Question: You are designing an experiment and need high power. You should:Reduce variability in your measurements.
Question: What type of error increases when you decrease α?Type II error.
Question: As the effect size increases, the power of the test will: Increase.
Question: The larger the standard deviation, the ______ the test statistic in a t-test. Smaller.
Question: In hypothesis testing, what does β represent?Type II error.
Question: An effect size describes:The size of the difference you are testing for.
Question: If the population standard deviation is known and the sample size is large, which test should be used?Z-test.
Question: Which of the following best describes an alternative hypothesis? A statement contradicting H0.
Question: If the power of a test is 0.9, the probability of a Type II error is: 0.1.
Question: A Type II error occurs when you:Fail to reject H0 when Ha is true.
Question: What does the Central Limit Theorem tell us?The sampling distribution of the mean approaches normality as sample size increases.
Question: When should you use the t-distribution instead of the normal distribution for hypothesis testing?When the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is small.
Question: Which of the following is NOT a condition for using a t-test?The population variance is known.
Question: A company tests a new ad campaign... What statistical test should be used?Two sample z-test for proportions.
