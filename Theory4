Week 10 (Regression)
•	Q: Which of the following is NOT an assumption of multiple linear regression?
A: Multicollinearity
•	Q: When adding a new predictor to a regression model, the adjusted R² decreases. What does this imply?
A: The new variable didn’t help and may harm model performance
•	Q: In a multiple regression model, multicollinearity refers to:
A: High correlation among independent variables
•	Q: If R² = 0.80 in a multiple regression model, what does this mean?
A: 80% of the variation in the outcome is explained by the predictors
•	Q: In multiple regression, what is 'dummy coding' used for?
A: Including categorical variables
•	Q: When interpreting regression coefficients, what does it mean to 'control for other variables'?
A: Hold other predictors constant while assessing one’s effect
•	Q: Which of the following is a possible consequence of multicollinearity?
A: Increased p-values
•	Q: The residuals in multiple regression should ideally be:
A: Randomly distributed with zero mean

•	Q: The main use of a time series model is to:
A: Predict future values
•	Q: Seasonality in data can be detected using:
A: Time series plot
•	Q: What type of time series shows regular fluctuations in specific periods like months or quarters?
A: Seasonality
•	Q: Which of these is not a component of time series?
A: Stationarity
