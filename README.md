Using the confidence interval approach:
n = 1001, p_hat = 0.11, ME = 0.03
P = percentage of all Americans that have objections on religious grounds to celebrating Halloween
H0: P = 0.1
H1: P > 0.1 
CI = (0.11 - 0.03, 0.11 + 0.03) = (0.08, 0.14)
since P = 0.1 is contained in the CI, we fail to reject the H0.
Therefore, the data does not support the fact that the news piece's statement is justified.

Using the p_value approach:

n = 1001, p_hat = 0.11, ME = 0.03

P = percentage of all Americans that have objections on religious grounds to celebrating Halloween

H0: P = 0.1

H1: P > 0.1 

Z = (0.11 - 0.1) / square root of blank end root(0.1 * 0.9/1001) = 0.01 / 0.0095 = 1.05

p_value = 1 - 0.8531 = 0.1469

since p_value > ∝ = 0.05, we fail to reject the H0.

Therefore, the data does not support the fact that the news piece's statement is justified.
