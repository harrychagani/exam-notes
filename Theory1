Question: What happens to the critical region if the significance level increases? It becomes larger.
Question: What does the "power" of a hypothesis test represent? Probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis.
Question: What is the significance level (α)? The probability of rejecting H0 when it is true.
Question: In hypothesis testing, the "effect size" measures? The magnitude of the difference between groups.
Question: In hypothesis testing, what does "power" measure? Probability of correctly rejecting H0.
Question: If you decrease the significance level (α) while keeping everything else the same, what happens to power? Power decreases.
Question: In hypothesis testing, if you increase α, what happens to β?It decreases.
Question: In hypothesis testing, which of these is NOT true?A p-value above α leads to rejecting H0.
Question: What happens to the t-distribution as degrees of freedom increase? It approaches normal distribution.
Question: The term "statistical significance" means? Results are unlikely under H0.
Question: A test with low power is more likely to? Make a Type II error.
Question: Which of the following will NOT affect the power of a hypothesis test? The color of the test report.
Question: The p-value depends on:Sample data.
Question: Which test would you use to compare the means of two independent samples? Independent samples t-test.
Question: Two hospitals report their recovery rates for a certain surgery. Hospital A has a 78% recovery rate (n=150), and Hospital B has an 85% recovery rate (n=180). What is the null hypothesis? The recovery rates are the same.
Question: Which distribution does the Chi-Square test statistic follow?Chi-Square.
Question: What does the Chi-Square test of independence assess? Association between two categorical variables.
Question: A Chi-Square statistic of 0 means? Observed equals expected.
Question: Chi-Square test statistics are always?  Positive.
Question: In a Chi-Square test, which value is compared to the critical value? Chi-Square test statistic.
Question: The larger the difference between observed and expected frequencies?The larger the Chi-Square value.
Question: Which of these is an example where Chi-Square is appropriate?Comparing proportions of males and females across departments.
Question: A paired t-test is also known as: A dependent samples t-test.
Question: The paired t-test is best used in which of the following scenarios?Measuring blood pressure before and after a drug is administered.
Question: Which of the following statements about t-distributions is TRUE? All of the above.
Question: A paired t-test is particularly useful when: The same subjects are measured twice under different conditions.
