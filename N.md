As sample size increases, standard error decreases (we become more precise).....
The sampling distribution shows how a statistic (like mean or proportion) varies from sample to sample.....
The standard deviation of the sampling distribution is called the standard error.....
The sampling distribution of the sample mean is approximately normal if the sample size is large, even if the population distribution is skewed.....
Higher confidence (e.g., 99%) → Wider interval...
More variability (higher standard deviation) → Wider interval....
Smaller sample size → Less precise, so interval gets wider.....
0.032(p=8)....6(dice=6)....MCQ0.0791....0.072/03(
population mean doesn't effect the width of confidence interval....
std understaded CI becomes narrower
outlier increases width of CI
