Week 7 (Ttest)
•	Q: Which assumption is NOT required for a paired t-test?
A: The samples are independent
•	Q: If a paired t-test produces a p-value of 0.08, what can we conclude at a 5% significance level?
A: The null hypothesis is not rejected
•	Q: Which of the following affects the width of a confidence interval in a paired t-test?
A: All of the above
•	Q: In a two-tailed paired t-test, the rejection region is in:
A: Both tails
•	Q: A paired t-test is particularly useful when:
A: The same subjects are measured twice under different conditions
•	Q: When should you use the t-distribution instead of the normal distribution for hypothesis testing?
A: When the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is small
•	Q: Which of the following statements about t-distributions is TRUE?
A: All of the above
•	Q: A one-sample t-test is equivalent to a paired t-test when:
A: The second sample is artificially created by subtracting a constant from the first sample
•	Q: A paired t-test is appropriate when:
A: Data is collected from the same subjects before and after treatment

(POWER)
•	Q: A test has low power because the effect size is very small. What is the best way to improve power in this case?
A: Increase the sample size
•	Q: If a study has low power, what does that mean?
A: It has a high probability of failing to detect a true effect
•	Q: A researcher wants to detect a 3-unit change in test scores with 80% power and a significance level of 0.05. Which of the following would increase the power of the test?
A: Increasing the significance level
•	Q: A hypothesis test has a power of 75%. What is the probability of making a Type I error when the significance level is 0.05?
A: 0.05
•	Q: A hospital is testing whether a new treatment lowers patient recovery time. If they set α = 0.01 instead of 0.05, what happens to the power of the test?
A: The power decreases
•	Q: A test has a power of 85%. What does this mean?
A: The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false is 85%
•	Q: A company is testing if a new marketing strategy increases sales. They want 95% confidence and 90% power. What does this mean?
A: They have a 90% chance of detecting a true effect
•	Q: A test is underpowered. What does this mean?
A: It is unlikely to detect a true effect
•	Q: What is the purpose of using standardized coefficients (beta weights)?
A: Compare the relative importance of predictors
Week 9 (ANOVA)
•	Q: Which of the following is an assumption of one-way ANOVA?
A: Variances across groups should be approximately equal
•	Q: Which of the following would violate the assumptions of ANOVA?
A: Very unequal variances across groups
•	Q: A company is testing four marketing strategies and measuring sales performance. ANOVA shows p = 0.18. What does this suggest?
A: No significant difference in sales between strategies
•	Q: In a one-way ANOVA, a high F-statistic usually means:
A: The group means are likely different
